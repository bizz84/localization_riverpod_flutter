# Simplified Flutter app template with localization support

This is a simplified version of the Flutter **skeleton app template** that can be generated like this:

```
flutter create -t skeleton project_name
```

It is based on this article:

- [https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-localization-build-context-extension/](Simplified Flutter Localization using a BuildContext extension)

## Localization

This project generates localized messages based on arb files found in
the `lib/src/localization` directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial on
[Internationalizing Flutter
apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization)
